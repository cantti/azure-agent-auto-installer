# Azure Agent Auto Installer

An example of a service that automatically looks up a list of computers in AD and installs the Azure Devops Agent on them. If the agent was removed, reinstalls it. May be useful in a corporate environment where you need to automate the installation of the Azure Agent. The code is just an example and POC and was taken from a real system with a lot of simplifications.
